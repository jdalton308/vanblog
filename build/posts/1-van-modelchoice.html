For me, this was the biggest part of the process, and was dependent almost entirely on what was on the market, since I was not willing to buy a brand new van. But, since I knew I would be living in it, I was also willing to invest in something shiny and reliable.</p><p>After going back and forth for a few months, I narrowed down my perfect van to these minimum criteria:</p><ul class="styled"><li>At least six feet tall inside (I am about 6'3")</li><li>Possible to drive in the city (Shorter than 14 feet long)</li><li>Less than 100,000 miles</li></ul>In addition, these are what I was considering, as you probably would too:<ul class="styled"><li>Gas mileage</li><li>Backup camera</li><li>Reliability reviews</li></ul><p>With those in mind, here are what I researched and considered:</p><section><h3>Ford Transit</h3><p>In America, this is a new model as of 2015. (In Europe, though, I discovered this model has been standard for years.) It is tall, and is direct competition with the Sprinter.</p><div class="button-links"><h4>Links:</h4><a href="//www.ford.com/trucks/transitvanwagon/" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Van Site</a> <a href="//www.ford.com/trucks/transitvanwagon/specifications/" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Specs Page</a> <a href="//www.caranddriver.com/ford/transit" class="button blue-button">Car and Driver Review</a> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_transit-wagon_2015" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Car Connection (2015)</a></div><table class="van-table"><tbody><tr><td>Pros:</td><td><ul><li>Tall options</li><li>New model, so new features</li><li>Impressive gas mileage</li><li>Won most comparison competitions (link: Car & Driver)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Cons:</td><td><ul><li>New model, so no used vans available and still expensive</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h3>Mercedes Sprinter</h3><p>The classic choice, and the go-to van model for building a custom van, though this is mostly because until 2014, it was the only tall van sold in America. Now every manufacturer (except Chevy) has a tall option that competes with the Sprinter, yet it is still worth considering for a few reasons:</p><div class="button-links"><h4>Links:</h4><a href="//www.mbvans.com/sprinter/home" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Van Site</a> <a href="//www.mbvans.com/sprinter/commercial-vans/cargo-van" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Specs Page</a> <a href="//www.caranddriver.com/mercedes-benz/sprinter" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Car and Driver Review</a> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_sprinter-passenger-vans_2015" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Car Connection (2015)</a></div><table class="van-table"><tbody><tr><td>Pros:</td><td><ul><li>Tall options</li><li>Used models available</li><li>Reviews and tests are great (link: Car & Driver)</li><li>4x4 option available</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Cons:</td><td><ul><li>The most expensive van listed here, with a high resale price as well</li><li>A poor reputation for reliability (link)</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h3>Ram Promaster</h3><p>And this is Dodge's tall van. It is distinct from the previous two models by it's short wheelbase/ tall height option, and it's exagerated boxiness.</p><div class="button-links"><h4>Links:</h4><a href="//www.ramtrucks.com/en/ram_promaster/" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Van Site</a> <a href="//www.ramtrucks.com/en/ram_promaster/#app-specs" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Specs Page</a> <a href="//www.caranddriver.com/ram/promaster" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Car and Driver</a> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ram_promaster_2015" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Car Connection (2015)</a></div><table class="van-table"><tbody><tr><td>Pros:</td><td><ul><li>New model, so new features</li><li>Great gas mileage</li><li>Front-wheel Driver</li><li>Shortest wheelbase (136") for a tall height (110") (Transit and Sprinter are both 144" long)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Cons:</td><td><ul><li>Model released in 2014, so few used available</li><li>Poor testing reviews (<a href="//www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/diesel-cargo-vans-compared-ford-transit-vs-mercedes-benz-sprinter-ram-promaster-comparison-test" target="_blank">here</a>)</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h3>Used Chevy Express</h3><p>If you are a climber, then you probably know Alex Honnold used to drive one of these (link). This is a traditional cargo van, with no factory high-tops available, but they have been produced for a decade and there quite a few on the market used, so this could be the cheapest option to go with, while still keepign the blank canvas on the interior. But, I would not consider buying this model new for our purpose, since the previous three are similar cost and taller.</p><div class="button-links"><h4>Links:</h4><a href="//www.ramtrucks.com/en/ram_promaster/" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Van Site</a> <a href="//www.ramtrucks.com/en/ram_promaster/#app-specs" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Specs Page</a> <a href="//www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/express" target="_blank" class="button blue-button">Car and Driver</a></div><table class="van-table"><tbody><tr><td>Pros:</td><td><ul><li>Many available used, at any price point</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Cons:</td><td><ul><li>No high-top available</li><li>Poor gas mileage</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h3>Minivan</h3><p>There are also reasons to stick with a minivan, and here's a couple that loves living in theirs (youtube link).
