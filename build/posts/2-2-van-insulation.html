<div class="post"><h4 class="post-date">June 4, 2016</h4><h4 class="post-type">Van</h4><h2 class="post-title">Van Build: Insulation</h2><div class="post-body"><p>There a few different opinions about installing insulation in a van. The main concern is around the moisture that exists when condensation occurs. If this moisture gets trapped between the metal and your insulation, then rust eventually will occur. Researching this a little, I decided to keep the insulation on the minimal side, and avoided trying to make anything air-tight.</p><p>That said, I am mainly staying on the west coast, and do not anticipate any temperatures below freezing or anything searing hot. So for me, a minimal approach works. If this is going to be your ski van, or if you have a little more time to construct the layers and barriers, then maybe choose a more robust route.</p><p>My approach was, basically, to add a bit of mass to the walls, and cover as much as I could in rigid styrofoam. To break down the layers, starting from the exterior and working in: the van wall, 1/4" reflectix, 2" styrofoam, and then the wood paneling. That's it. And the same approach was used for the ceiling as for the sides.</p><p>After living in the van for almost six months now, I am pretty happy with the temperature regulation. Most of the time, the back of the van is just a little warmer than the exterior temperature, unless it's parked in the shade. Given how much time I had to build my van (two weeks, while working a day job), I am happy with what I have, but I am a little envious of people who are able to safely put in thicker insulation.</p><section><h3>Insulation</h3><h4>Materials</h4><ul class="styled"><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XCJA2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joe055-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0009XCJA2&linkId=6984195fa1e49506f25ca6536ffcb28e" target="_blank">24"x50' Reflectix Insulation</a></li><li>2" and 1.5" Rigid Styrofoam</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HSCNM4O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joe055-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00HSCNM4O&linkId=21b8925a2b46bc873a6109dc7c065329" target="_blank">3M Spray Adhesive</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HT720O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joe055-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B001HT720O&linkId=243357c38d6911d52e4d42c059c12121" target="_blank">Duct Tape</a></li></ul><h4>Tools</h4><ul class="styled"><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002X204/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00002X204&linkCode=as2&tag=joe055-20&linkId=6f636d5f71d844d152e22fe7b15407a4" target="_blank">Retractable Utility Knife</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002X2GQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joe055-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00002X2GQ&linkId=5435362cd3981665756e94ab14ebb975" target="_blank">Measuring Tape</a></li></ul><ol><li><h4>Reflectix</h4><p>I saw a lot of people using this in their van builds, so I looked into it, and it seemed like a great low-profile way to increase the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=home_sealing.hm_improvement_insulation_table" target="_blank">R-value</a>.</p><p>First I went through section of the van and cut a piece of Reflectix to size. After cutting each piece, I simply used the spray adhesive to stick each one in place, spraying both the van wall and the piece to be attached. That's it.</p><figure><img src="/img/Posts/Build/van-insulation2.jpg" alt="Getting started with attaching the Reflectix"><figcaption>Getting started with covering the walls in Reflectix.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="/img/Posts/Build/van-insulation.jpg" alt="the reflectix attached"><figcaption>The Reflectix insulation attached with the spray glue to every open wall area.</figcaption></figure></li><li><h4>Rigid Foam</h4><p>Next, I basically repeated the process used for the Reflectix, but for the 2" rigid foam. Wherever they would fit, I cut out pieces to be stuck right on top of the Reflectix, again using the spray adhesive to stick them on. As insurance, I also put some duct tape around each piece.</p><figure><img src="/img/Posts/Build/van-door-frame.jpg" alt="Example of rigid styrofoam attached"><figcaption>Before the furring strips were attached (next section), the rigid styrofoam was glued over the reflectix.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="/img/Posts/Build/van-framing2.jpg" alt="Start of the framing"><figcaption>The rigid foam covering most of the panels.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="/img/Posts/Build/van-progress16.jpg" alt="First section covered with paneling"><figcaption>We were doing a lot at once, but the insulation on the ceiling is seen here, with just 1/2" rigid foam.</figcaption></figure></li></ol></section></div></div><div class="adbox"><h4>Advertisement</h4><div class="alignleft"><script type="text/javascript">amzn_assoc_ad_type = "banner";
