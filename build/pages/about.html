<h1>About</h1><div class="post"><h2>Purpose</h2><p>The main purpose of this blog is to share my experiences with building a van to live in, and then living in it. And since this is still a "blog", I also share me stories about my adventures, sometimes relating to the van, but sometimes not. I will also, on occasion, give some thoughts about climbing, which is one my passions, however #vanlife and travel are the focus.</p><h2>Audience</h2><p>If you are reading this page, then this blog is probably for you. It is no mystery that the "#vanlife" movement is strong, and I notice more and more vans everywhere I go. Some are calling it the new <a href="//blog.theclymb.com/places-and-adventure-travel/viva-la-van-life-the-new-american-dream" target="_blank">"American Dream"</a>. I don't know how "new" of an idea this lifestyle is, but anyone who has some appreciation for living a simple lifestyle will hopefully find this blog interesting. You don't need to be an adventurer yourself, or even have plans to be, but if you dream of experiencing new things and those things involve trees and rivers and mountains, or just vans, then this blog is for you.</p><h2>Me</h2><p>My name is Joe. I am from the Midwest, growing up in a town with less that 1000 people. Through college I lived in Michigan and Minnesota, then In 2014 I came out to California for a job. I was not very happy at that job, so I learned to code, started a career in Web Development, and over the next two years I happily worked for a couple design agencies in San Francisco.</p><p>Living in a van, though, has been on my mind for years. The idea was actually first brought up by my Mom, when I was in college probably, and I don't know where she got the idea. She simply thought it would be cool to live in a trailer on a beach somewhere. But remember, we were from Michigan, so anything on a beach sounded great most months of the year. Then, when I moved out to California, I started rock climbing. All you rock climbers out there know that living in a van, or even just a tiny sedan, has been <a href="//www.climbing.com/news/the-wright-stuff-dirtbagging-is-dead/" target="_blank">commonplace for decades. Flip through an issue of <em><a href="//www.climbing.com" target="_blank">Climbing Magazine</a></em> and they mention living in a van every-other article.</a></p><p>So my mom seeded the idea, then the culture I surrounded myself with made it grow. My desire was also fueled by financial reasons: I was living in the most expensive city in the country (San Francisco), and have an embarrasing amount of student loan debt. Even if I wasn't traveling, living in a van gave an alternative to paying stupid-high rent every month, with the added bonus of being able to travel. Between the climbing, family support, and financial gain, it felt like an easy decision.</p><p>Still, I debated with myself for months, spending days shopping for a van online only to convince myself that I really liked having a toilet and high-speed internet. But then, the perfect van appeared at a local dealer in January 2016: A gently used Ram Promaster. I went down to check it out, haggled for a deal with my less-than-stellar credit, and came home with a cargo van and two weeks to make it into my home. February 1, 2016 I moved into the van. Then on May 13, I quit my job and hit the road to climb and experience the US, and the rest of my story is probably in this blog somewhere.</p></div><div class="post"><h2>A Freelance Web Developer</h2><p>So indeed, I still need to make a living while traveling.
