#Van Blog

###Description
This is a self-hosted blog site, built on a Node.js server.

###Creating a new post
1. Write the post
2. Save the file as `[overall post #]-[main category]-[title]`. For example, `1-van-modelchoice.html`. This is just for convention, and does not impact any logic.
3. Update the `server-post-ref.js` file with post details
4. Update the `server-path-ref.js` file, after deciding on the URL to be used
