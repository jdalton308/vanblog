	<div class="post-body">
		<p>The first step in building a van to adventure or live in is, as expected, choosing the van. For me, this was the biggest part of the process, and was dependent almost entirely on what was on the market, since I was not willing to buy a brand new van. But, since I knew I would be living in it, I was also willing to invest in something shiny and reliable.</p>

		<p>After going back and forth for a few months, I narrowed down my perfect van to these minimum criteria:</p>
		<ul class="styled">
			<li>At least six feet tall inside (I am about 6'3")</li>
			<li>Possible to drive in the city (Shorter than 14 feet long)</li>
			<li>Less than 100,000 miles</li>
		</ul>

		In addition, these are what I was considering, as you probably would too:
		<ul class="styled">
			<li>Gas mileage</li>
			<li>Backup camera</li>
			<li>Reliability reviews</li>
		</ul>

		<p>With those in mind, here are what I researched and considered:</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Ford Transit</h3>
			<p>In America, this is a new model as of 2015. (In Europe, though, I discovered this model has been standard for years.)  It is tall, and is direct competition with the Sprinter.</p>

			<table class=van-table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Pros:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>Tall options</li>
								<li>New model, so new features</li>
								<li>Impressive gas mileage</li>
								<li>Won most comparison competitions (link: Car & Driver)</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cons:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>New model, so no used vans available and still expensive</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</section>
			

		<section>
			<h3>Mercedes Sprinter</h3>
			<p>The classic choice, and the go-to van model for building a custom van, though this is mostly because until 2014, it was the only tall van sold in America. Now every manufacturer (except Chevy) has a tall option that competes with the Sprinter, yet it is still worth considering for a few reasons:</p>

			<table class=van-table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Pros:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>Tall options</li>
								<li>Used models available</li>
								<li>Reviews and tests are great (link: Car & Driver)</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cons:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>The most expensive van listed here, with a high resale price as well</li>
								<li>A poor reputation for reliability (link)</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</section>


		<section>
			<h3>Ram Promaster</h3>
			<p>And this is Dodge's tall van. It is distinct from the previous two models by it's short wheelbase/ tall height option, and it's exagerated boxiness.</p>

			<table class=van-table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Pros:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>New model, so new features</li>
								<li>Great gas mileage</li>
								<li>Shortest wheelbase (136") for a tall height (110") (Transit and Sprinter are both 144" long)</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cons:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>Model released in 2014, so few used available</li>
								<li>Poor testing reviews (<a href="//www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/diesel-cargo-vans-compared-ford-transit-vs-mercedes-benz-sprinter-ram-promaster-comparison-test" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</section>
			

		<section>
			<h3>Used Chevy Express</h3>
			<p>If you are a climber, then you probably know Alex Honnold used to drive one of these (link).  This is a traditional cargo van, with no factory high-tops available, but they have been produced for a decade and there quite a few on the market used, so this could be the cheapest option to go with, while still keepign the blank canvas on the interior.  But, I would not consider buying this model new for our purpose, since the previous three are similar cost and taller.</p>

			<table class=van-table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Pros:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>Many available used, at any price point</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cons:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>No high-top available</li>
								<li>Poor gas mileage</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</section>


		<section>
			<h3>Minivan</h3>
			<p>There are also reasons to stick with a minivan, and here's a couple that loves living in theirs (youtube link). If you are trying to be super covert or as small as possible, this could be a great option.</p>

			<table class=van-table>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Pros:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>Many avialable, at any price</li>
								<li>Could be very cheap</li>
								<li>Small physical footprint</li>
								<li>Relatively great gas mileage</li>
								<li>Easy getting insurance</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cons:</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>Super small space inside</li>
								<li>Covering the windows every night (if being covert)</li>
								<li>Super small space</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
