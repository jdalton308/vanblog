	<div class="post-body">
		<p>Listed here are the main construction and build-out pieces of the van. Basically all the carpentry. Lucky for me, I happen to know a guy who has a degree in construction engineering: My dad. He has been building things probably forever, so his brain and his tool shed were a huge support.</p>
		<p>But, even if you do not have every power tool available in your backyard, just some weekend rentals of a few key tools are all you should need to accomplish what we did. Just do your fingers a favor and read the operating instructions.</p>

		<p>It should also be said that most of this work took place over just three weekends, though it was planned out before getting started.</p>

			<h3>Flooring</h3>

			<h4>Materials</h4>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>Subflooring</li>
				<li>Underlayment Material</li>
				<li>Flooring</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Tools</h4>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>Jigsaw</li>
				<li>Chopsaw or circular saw</li>
				<li>Razor knife</li>
				<li>Duct tape</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Like any part of this build, there are obviously a lot of different ways to go about this, depending on what you need. I am sufficiently afraid of trapping moisture and creating rust, so I decided to go a more minimal approach to the flooring and insulation.</p>

			<p>When I bought the van, it already had a flat plastic flooring piece that covered the whole rear bed. I decided to just keep this in place and install the flooring on top of it, rather than try to insulate the floor. Overall, the flooring was probably the easiest part of the van.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Subflooring</h4>
					<p>The purpose of the subflooring is to simply provide a level surface for the floorboards to rest on. Lucky for me, my van already had a 1/4" plastic floor cover in the rear.  I am not sure if this was an optional, or just comes standard, but I decided to use it.</p>
					<p>Alternatively, you could put down sheets of about 1/4" plywood, or thicker if your floor isn't completely flat. Some people choose to also insulate the floor, below the subflooring, and if you'll be in any colder areas, I think thorough insulation is probably a good idea. But, the more material on the floor means the more lost vertical space in the van: Adding another 1/2" of material on the floor means that I would hit my head that much more ofter. So, since I am just planning to stay on the West coast of the US, which has very mild temperatures year round, I skipped the extra step.</p>

					<h4>Underlayment</h4>
					<p>If you are using laminate flooring, you will probably want to put down underlayment material between the base and the flooring. Depending on the flooring you choose, though, you might be able to skip it, as some laminate flooring has it pre-installed with the flooring pieces.</p>
					<p>If you are using real wood, then here's the first link I found on Google for <a href="//www.diynetwork.com/how-to/rooms-and-spaces/floors/how-to-install-prefinished-solid-hardwood-flooring" target="_blank">installing them</a>.</p>
					<p>I chose <a href="//www.homedepot.com/p/FloorMuffler-100-sq-ft-4-ft-x-25-ft-x-0-08-in-for-Engineered-Hardwood-and-Laminate-Floors-0264049/204077418">this underlayment</a>. I am not sure how much of a difference it makes in a van, but the choices have different sound insulation, heat insulation, and waterproof properties. I chose one of the more sound-dampening ones that is also waterproof, to avoid any mold or rust from condensation or a spill.</p>
					<p>Whatever underlayment you choose, just follow the instructions to attach it. I also used some duct tape in a couple places just to make it easier to work with.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="/img/Posts/Build/van-flooring3.jpg" alt="van flooring">

					</figure>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Flooring</h4>
					<p>Now for the fun part: Install the flooring on top of the underlayment. To start I laid out the pieces to get an idea of the textures and colors, and roughly situate them how I wanted, since each flooring piece is a little different. Next I just started in a corner and worked my way left-to-right, and front-to-back, starting each row with the end of the cut-piece from the previous row. This kept the seams pretty scattered.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>Around the wheel-wells I used the jigsaw to notch the flooring, but the whole process is pretty simple; sort of like a big, easy jig-saw puzzle. I would be more work with real wood flooring, which might be another reason to stick with laminate.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately I did end up with an awkward gap at the rear. One too small to rip a flooring piece to fit, yet large enough to be noticable. Since I just open the back when I get climbing gear out, I don't mind, but if you have more pride in your carpentry skills than I do, then you might want to measure the length of you bed, divide by the width of the floor-boards you are using, and ensure you start in a sport that will give you a decent finishing length.</p>

			<h3>Insulation</h3>

			<p>There a few different opinions about installing insulation in a van. The main issue is around the moisture that exists when condensation occurs. If this moisture gets trapped between the metal and your insulation, then rust eventually will occur. Reading about this, I decided to keep my insulation pretty minimal.</p>
			<p>But, I am mainly staying on the west coast, and do not anticipate any temperatures below freezing, and I try to aviod anything too hot, so for, a minimal approach works. If this is going to be your ski van, then maybe choose a more robust route.</p>
			<p>My approach was just to basically add a bit of mass to the walls, and cover as much as I could in rigid styrofoam that would fit behind the paneling without losing any more space. I also don't try to create a moisture barrier. To break down the layers, starting from the exterior and working in: van wall, 1/4" reflectix, 2" styrofoam, and then the wood paneling. And the same approach was used for the ceiling as for the sides.</p>
			<p>After living in the van for almost six months now, I am pretty happy with the temperature regulation. Most of the time, the back of the van is just a little warmer than the exterior temperature, unless it's parked in the shade. Given how much time I had to build my van (two weeks, while working a day job), I am happy with what I have, but I am a little envious of people who are able to safely put in proper insulation, like fiberglass or its equivalent.</p>

			<h4>Materials</h4>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>24" Roll of Reflectix Insulation</li>
				<li>2" and 1.5" Rigid Styrofoam</li>
				<li>3M Spray Adhesive</li>
				<li>Duct tape</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Tools</h4>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>Razor knife</li>
				<li>Measuring tape</li>
			</ul>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Reflectix</h4>
					<p>I saw a lot of people using this in their van builds, so I looked into it, and it seemed like a great low-profile way to increase the <a href="" target="_blank">R-value</a>.</p>
					<p>First I went through section of the van and cut a piece of Reflectix to size. After cutting each piece, I simply used the spray adhesive to stick each one in place, spraying both the van wall and the piece to be attached. That's it.</p>

					</figure>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Rigid Foam</h4>
					<p>Next, I basically repeated the process used for the Reflectix, but for the 2" rigid foam. Wherever they would fit, I cut out pieces to be stuck right on top of the Reflectix, again using the spray adhesive to stick them on. As insurance, I also put some duct tape around each piece.</p>

			<h3>Walls and Ceiling</h3>

			<p>From the way the Promaster van is built, each side-wall of the van is basically divided in half by a metal support piece, and, of course, the right side has the door. So, the van can be divided into five secions that get paneling: two for each side-wall, and the ceiling.</p>
			<p>When my dad and I did this, he got started doing the framing and paneling in the rear two sections while I got started on the electical work around the front area. This worked out really well for us, but if you are doing this by yourself, then probably start with the electical work first, unless you don't plan on hiding any wiring behind the walls.</p>

			<h4>Materials</h4>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>Furring Strips: 1"x2"x8'</li>
				<li>Cedar Planks: 3"x8'</li>
				<li>Self-driving Screws: 1.25"</li>
				<li>1/2" nails for nail-gun</li>
				<li>Liquid Nail Adhesive</li>
				<li>Finish stain and polyurthane</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Tools</h4>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>Level</li>
				<li>Measuring tape</li>
				<li>Chopsaw or circular saw</li>
				<li>Jigsaw</li>
				<li>Driver or drill</li>
				<li>Finish nail-gun</li>
				<li>Paint brush or cloth</li>
			</ul>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Furring</h4>
					<p>First step is getting the framing up. We just used the 1"x2" furring strips for this. On the door and in the kitchen-area, we spaced them about 16" apart, but in the back two wall sections, where the bed is, we spaced them about a foot apart, to add some extra rigidity. This has turned out to be a wise move, since I lean up against this area all the time, and have yet to feel the wall flex.</p>
					<p>Where exactly you attach the strips will depend on your van's design. For us, we were able to do strips that run from floor to ceiling (except on the door), screwing and glueing each one at the bottom, top, and somewhere in the middle; basically a screw wherever the strip crossed the metal frame of the van.</p>
					<p>The most important thing when putting up the furring strips is to make sure they are all flush with each other. The paneling strips will flex a little, but they won't stay attached if there is too much. Take this into consideration when cutting each strip to size. For us, just about every piece was a unique length.</p>
					<p>When attaching each piece, we also put a dab of Liquid Nail adhesive at each point that touched metal. My grandpa is a finish carpenter, and told me a long time ago that a screw or nail will hold a joint pretty tight, but a little glue will make it stay tight. So just use some glue where you can; your van will vibrate a lot.</p>

					<h4>Paneling</h4>
					<p>This was the most tedious part of the whole van build. We used 3" wide cedar paneling strips, mainly because that was the only size that Home Depot had, and I didn't feel like going to another lumber store. In hindsight, I wish I had picked something wider, since it took forever to put these up. Using 6" or 8" pieces still would have looked great, but saved a few hours of work. This is especially true on the ceiling. Still, I am really happy with how it turned out.</p>
					<p>We started with the paneling in this order: Sides, ceiling, door. The door was last because of the the pieces we cut to cover the metal frame had to go over the ceiling, and the ceiling was second because on the edges we had it come down over the sides, rather than having them run flush together.</p>
					<p>So starting with the sides, we then worked from top to bottom. Remember to make sure the first piece is level, then we attached each piece with a touch of glue on the back, then three nails at each furring strip. Also, we chose to just use a single piece for each row, rather than try to incorporate seams. It just made it move faster, and we were able to do this because each section is only five feet wide.</p>
					<p>Around some corners and the wheel-wells, we had to use the jigsaw for some angled and awkward cuts. In the end, these were the pieces that really gave it a refined feel.</p>

					<h4>Ceiling</h4>
					<p>This part was work. Again, make sure you have the lighting and electical situation planned out first. Once you do, start in the middle of the van and work outward to the sides. It probably goes without saying, but the first piece up is the most important. For us, this piece also had two lights attached to it. I'll go over the holes we cut for the lights in the post on the electrical system.</p>
					<p>Going back to the furring strips, again we were at the mercy of the van's design for the ceiling. In the Promaster, there are pieces of the metal frame that run side-to-side, which I decided to use to attache the furring strips, plus along the front and rear of the van. The downside of this is that these metal frame pieces already stick down about an inch, so that creates an inch of lost space in height. Some of this was taken up by the insulation, but I was hoping to find a way to keep that inch, but I wasn't about to screw the ceiling directly to the metal.</p>
					<p>With the furring strips up (and the solar panels and roof vent already installed too), the paneling went up just as it did on the sides, working from the center of the van outwards. Once we hit the edges, I just attached an panel piece at a 45-degree angle to try and cover the gap. To do this we also made some tiny furring pieces with 45-degree cuts in the them for some support. This worked OK, but there is still a small gap below the 45-degree pices, so maybe you could do something a little cleaner here.</p>

					<h4>Finish Trim</h4>
					<p>Now that most of the sides and ceiling were covered, all that was left was to cover the metal frame that was still exposed. This was different for each area, but mostly involved constructing something like a soffet with a couple furring strips and paneling pieces, and boxing up each area that was exposed. This was where your finish carpentry skills will shine.</p>

			<h3>Bed</h3>

			<p>So my dad built this part, basically by himself. We debated the plans a little, but he did the construction.</p>

			<h4>Materials</h4>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>2"x4"x8' - x7</li>
				<li>2"x4"x10' - x4</li>
				<li>Framing nails (for nail-gun)</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Tools</h4>
			<ul class="styled">
				<li>Tape measure</li>
				<li>Chopsaw or circular saw</li>
				<li>Framing nail-gun</li>
				<li>T-square</li>
				<li>Level</li>
			</ul>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Plans</h4>
					<p>As an overview of the plan, I basically wanted a full-size bed that was three feet off the floor, making room for storage underneath while still leaving space to sit up in bed. I also wanted to keep the floor clear is areas, so that stuff could be easily slid along the floor when taking it out from under the bed.</p>
					<p>I initally wanted a platform that was hinged in the middle, and could be lifted only the edges to get access to the storage below, but my dad vetoed that idea, and I haven't missed it since. We also decided to not have the frame attached to anything, like the walls for floor, in case I want to change the layout later on.</p>
					<p>So there really is nothing clever going on here, just a rock-solid bed frame that sits high off the floor.</p>
