	<h2 class="post-title">Van Build: Insulation</h2>

	<div class="post-body">

		<p>There a few different opinions about installing insulation in a van. The main concern is around the moisture that exists when condensation occurs. If this moisture gets trapped between the metal and your insulation, then rust eventually will occur. Researching this a little, I decided to keep the insulation on the minimal side, and avoided trying to make anything air-tight.</p>
		<p>That said, I am mainly staying on the west coast, and do not anticipate any temperatures below freezing or anything searing hot. So for me, a minimal approach works. If this is going to be your ski van, or if you have a little more time to construct the layers and barriers, then maybe choose a more robust route.</p>
		<p>My approach was, basically, to add a bit of mass to the walls, and cover as much as I could in rigid styrofoam. To break down the layers, starting from the exterior and working in: the van wall, 1/4" reflectix, 2" styrofoam, and then the wood paneling. That's it. And the same approach was used for the ceiling as for the sides.</p>
		<p>After living in the van for almost six months now, I am pretty happy with the temperature regulation. Most of the time, the back of the van is just a little warmer than the exterior temperature, unless it's parked in the shade. Given how much time I had to build my van (two weeks, while working a day job), I am happy with what I have, but I am a little envious of people who are able to safely put in thicker insulation.</p>

					<h4>Reflectix</h4>
					<p>I saw a lot of people using this in their van builds, so I looked into it, and it seemed like a great low-profile way to increase the <a href="" target="_blank">R-value</a>.</p>
					<p>First I went through section of the van and cut a piece of Reflectix to size. After cutting each piece, I simply used the spray adhesive to stick each one in place, spraying both the van wall and the piece to be attached. That's it.</p>

					<h4>Rigid Foam</h4>
					<p>Next, I basically repeated the process used for the Reflectix, but for the 2" rigid foam. Wherever they would fit, I cut out pieces to be stuck right on top of the Reflectix, again using the spray adhesive to stick them on. As insurance, I also put some duct tape around each piece.</p>
